# ðŸ§¬ Biological Data Visualization with R

Welcome to Biological Data Visualization, a curated collection of compelling and insightful visualizations designed to explore genomic variations using R programming.

This repository showcases powerful ways to interpret biological datasets, making it easier to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers in genomic data.
# ðŸ“ˆ What's Inside?

# ðŸ”¹ Bar Plot

Visualizes variation counts per chromosome â€” perfect for quickly assessing distribution across the genome.

# ðŸ”¹ Scatter Plot

Compares reference vs. query sequences, allowing intuitive detection of similarities, shifts, and anomalies.

# ðŸ”¹ Venn Diagram

Highlights gene overlaps between datasets â€” useful for identifying common or unique genes in multiple conditions or experiments.

# ðŸ”¹ Violin Plot

Depicts the distribution of variations across different groups, combining box plot precision with distribution shape.
